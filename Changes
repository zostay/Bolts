    * Bugfix: The push key to Bolts::artifact() was incorrectly using a 1-based
      index for injector keys rather than a 0-based index.
    * Replaced Bolts::Role::Locator with a version that only declares the
      required parameters.
    * Copied the original Bolts::Role::Locator to Bolts::Role::RootLocator and
      made it implement Bolts::Role::Locator
    * Converted Bolts::Role::SelfLocator, Bolts::Locator, and
      Bolts::Meta::Locator to use Bolts::Role::RootLocator.
    * Made Bolts::Meta::Class::Trait::Locator into an implementation of
      Bolts::Role::Locator.
    * Added a new init_locator attribute to Bolts::Artifact
    * Changed blueprint, scope, and injectors so that they can take a special
      initializer argument during construction that takes the form of a
      Bolts::Meta::Initializer reference that can be used to acquire the
      blueprint, scope, and injectors (respectively) rather than require they be
      delivered directly by the caller. This is much nicer to use directly now.
    * Added Bolts::Role::Initializer and the Bolts::Intializer attribute trait
      to make objects that can be initialized through the use of their own
      personal locator convenient. This is a slight deviation from pure IOC, but
      very convenient in some cases.
    * Modify locator_for() and meta_locator_for() in Bolts::Util to return
      the same locator object for each invocation after the first for a given
      object reference.
