    * Replaced Bolts::Role::Locator with a version that only declares the
      required parameters.
    * Copied the original Bolts::Role::Locator to Bolts::Role::RootLocator and
      made it implement Bolts::Role::Locator
    * Converted Bolts::Role::SelfLocator, Bolts::Locator, and
      Bolts::Meta::Locator to use Bolts::Role::RootLocator.
    * Made Bolts::Meta::Class::Trait::Locator into an implementation of
      Bolts::Role::Locator.
    * Added a new required meta_locator attribute to Bolts::Artifact
    * Changed blueprint, scope, and injectors so that they can take a special
      initializer argument during construction that takes the form of an array
      reference that can be used to acquire the blueprint, scope, and injectors
      (respectively) rather than require they be delivered directly by the
      caller. This is much nicer to use directly now.
    * Modify locator_for() and meta_locator_for() in Bolts::Util to return
      the same locator object for each invocation after the first for a given
      object reference.
